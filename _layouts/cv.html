        <h6>2020 - Current<b>Doctoral Researcher - LORIA</b> - Nancy, France</h6>
        <p>
            PhD Candidate at the Multispeech research team at LORIA, under the supervision of Dr. Yves Laprie. My work focuses on the deep supervision of the vocal tract shape for articulatory speech synthesis.
        </p>

        <h6>2018 - 2020<b>Data Science Specialist - DASA & Nexa Digital</b> - São Paulo, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            I joined Nexa Digital in October 2018 to help to build the data team from the beginning. Our goal was to structure the data in thousands of medical records in the PDF format. My work included developing the data infrastructure, building the high-performance data systems and pipelines in Python, and developing the machine learning and deep learning models, e.g., LSTMs, CNNs, Attention mechanisms, to understand the information available in the PDF file.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of 2019, the company was acquired by DASA, the 5th largest medical diagnosis company in the world. I started working at the company's innovation lab with radiology images, e.g., MRIs, PET, CTs. Our goal was to improve the clinical daily tasks and the patient's lives with artificial intelligence, mainly with deep neural networks.
        </p>

        <h6>2017 - 2018 <b>Data Science & Analytics - iFood & Rapiddo Delivery</b> - São Paulo, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            I joined Rapiddo Delivery in a trainee program organized by its investor, Movile. Working with different types of vehicles, the company provided a smart, fast, and safe platform to get anything delivered from one place to another. As part of the Data & Analytics team, I was responsible for designing models for all segments of our business, developing services for collecting and analyzing data and integrating the services with our platform in AWS. My main contribution was working on a dynamic pricing model that allowed the company to have a positive margin for the very first time in its history.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the beginning of 2018, Rapiddo was acquired by iFood, the leader in online food delivery in Brazil. After the M&A, I worked as a data scientist in the logistics team, providing intelligence behind our data. I also had the opportunity to lead and launch our mPOS system, one of our most strategic projects for the year of 2018. I was responsible for dealing with suppliers, the tech team, and all the stakeholders. As a result, I was the main responsible for increasing our demand by 30% in all cities we launched.
        </p>

        <h6>2016 - 2017 <b>Junior Software Engineer - Eldorado Research Institute</b> - Campinas, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            At Eldorado, I worked at an international project for Motorola Mobility. We were responsible for developing software automation tools to help the engineering teams all over the world to be more productive. As a software engineer, I worked mainly with Python programming language at a team that integrated people from US, Brazil, and India.
