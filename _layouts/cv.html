        <h4>Professional and Academic Experiences</h4>
        <br>

        <h6>2018 - Current <b>Data Scientist - Nexa Digital</b> - São Paulo, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            We are building the future of healthcare using advanced techniques of machine learning, AI, and other disruptive technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
            At Nexa Digital, my work as a data scientist includes the development of robust data pipelines and models to structure data from multiple sources. We apply deep learning (LSTMs, CNNs, and attention mechanisms) to retrieve information from medical records (NLP).
        </p>

        <p>
            My contribution is not limited to modeling, but also machine learning and data engineering. I am responsible for developing the software that ingests and digests the data. We have a sophisticated infrastructure to process highly sensitive data (health information) safely, and we need to be compliant with many regulations, e.g., LGPD.
        </p>

        <p>
            My most significant results include developing resilient software for receiving, processing, and storing the company's data, developing models to extract information from complex sources, and guaranteeing the governance and traceability of the processing.
        </p>

        <h6>2017 - 2018 <b>Data Science & Analytics - Rapiddo Delivery & iFood</b> - São Paulo, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            I joined Rapiddo Delivery in a trainee program organized by its investor, Movile. Working with different types of vehicles, the company provided a smart, fast, and safe platform to get anything delivered from one place to another. As part of the Data & Analytics team, I was responsible for designing models for all segments of our business, developing services for collecting and analyzing data and integrating the services with our platform in AWS. My main contribution was working on a dynamic pricing model that allowed the company to have a positive margin for the very first time in its history.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the beginning of 2018, Rapiddo was acquired by iFood, the leader in online food delivery in Brazil. After the M&A, I worked as a data scientist in the logistics team, providing intelligence behind our data. I also had the opportunity to lead and launch our mPOS system, one of our most strategic projects for the year of 2018. I was responsible for dealing with suppliers, the tech team, and all the stakeholders. As a result, I was the main responsible for increasing our demand by 30% in all cities we launched.
        </p>

        <h6>2016 - 2017 <b>Junior Software Engineer - Eldorado Research Institute</b> - Campinas, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            At Eldorado, I worked at an international project for Motorola Mobility. We were responsible for developing software automation tools to help the engineering teams all over the world to be more productive. As a software engineer, I worked mainly with Python programming language at a team that integrated people from US, Brazil, and India.
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from the main project, I dedicated time to improve my knowledge in Java programming language, Android development and software architecture. I also enrolled in technological workshops on computer vision, data science, and machine learning.
