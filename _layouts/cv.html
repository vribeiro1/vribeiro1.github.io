        <h4>Professional Experiences</h4>
        <br>

        <h6>2020 - Current<b> Doctoral Researcher - Loria</b> - Nancy, France</h6>
        <p>
            PhD Candidate at the Multispeech research team at Loria, under the supervision of Dr.
            Yves Laprie. My research is focused on machine learning methods for articulatory speech
            synthesis. I specifically work with the vocal tract shape estimation during continuous
            speech. The techniques I am using are autoencoders and recurrent neural networks.
        </p>

        <h6>2018 - 2020<b> Data Science Specialist - Dasa & Nexa Digital</b> - São Paulo, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            I joined Nexa Digital in October 2018 to help to build the data team. Our goal was to
            structure the data in thousands of medical records in PDF. My work included developing
            the data infrastructure, building the high-performance data systems and pipelines, and
            developing the machine learning and deep learning models to understand the information
            available in the PDF file.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2019, the company was acquired by Dasa, the 5th largest medical diagnosis company in
            the world. I started working at the company's innovation lab with radiology images. Our
            goal was to improve the clinical daily tasks and the patient's lives with artificial
            intelligence, mainly with deep neural networks.
        </p>

        <h6>2017 - 2018<b> Data Science & Analytics - iFood & Rapiddo Delivery</b> - São Paulo, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            I joined Rapiddo Delivery in a trainee program organized by its investor, Movile. The
            company provided a smart, fast, and safe platform to get anything delivered from one
            place to another. As part of the Data \& Analytics team, I was responsible for designing
            models, developing services for data collection and analysis and integrating the services
            with our platform. My main contribution was working on a dynamic pricing model that
            allowed the company to have a positive margin for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, Rapiddo was acquired by iFood, the leader in online food delivery in Brazil.
            After the M&A, I worked as a data scientist in the logistics team. I also had the opportunity
            to lead and launch our mPOS system, one of our most strategic projects for the year of
            2018. I was responsible for dealing with suppliers, the tech team, and other stakeholders.
            As a result, I was the main responsible for increasing our demand by 30\% in all cities
            we launched.
        </p>

        <h6>2016 - 2017<b> Junior Software Engineer - Eldorado Research Institute</b> - Campinas, Brazil</h6>
        <p>
            At Eldorado, I worked at an international project for Motorola Mobility. We were responsible
            for developing software automation tools to help the engineering teams to be more productive.
            As a software engineer, I worked mainly with Python at a team with people from the US,
            Brazil, and India.
