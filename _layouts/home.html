        <p>
            I've got my B. Sc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil, in 2016. Currently I'm a M. Sc. candidate in Machine Learning and Deep Learning at the same university. At the M. Sc. program, I'm enrolled on a project in which we apply deep learning techniques to the problem of skin lesion analysis. My contribution to the project includes applying a deep neural networks to generate a segmentation mask for skin lesion images. During the M. Sc. program I have also worked with mathematical modeling using different statistical techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have experience working as a Software Engineer, mainly working with Python programming language. I have worked with diverse and international teams, applying Agile management methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I'm focusing my career in Data Science. I'm highly motivated about building predictive models and quantitative studies to help companies address strategical issues in their businesses.
