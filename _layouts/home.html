            I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Université de Lorraine, France, where I
            worked at <a href="https://www.loria.fr/en/">Loria / Inria Grand-Est</a> as part of the
            <a href="https://team.inria.fr/multispeech/">Multispeech</a> team under the supervision
            of Dr. Yves Laprie.
        </p>

            I also hold a M. Sc. and a B. Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the University of
            Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil.
